to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the
word and adding ‘ay’. “The quick brown fox” becomes “Hetay uickqay rownbay

    <p>The quick brown fox</p>
    <!-- <p>A honey bee is a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade, all native to Eurasia but spread to four other continents by human beings. They are known for construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax, for the large size of their colonies, and for their surplus production and storage of honey, distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals, including honey badgers, bears and human hunter-gatherers.
